 * DefaultActionContributionOptions default options}, the following choices are available:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link Context context} in which the action is executed can be altered;
 * <li>The action's {@link ActionParameter parameters} can be {@link ActionContributionOptions#setParameter(String,
 *     ActionParameter) expanded};
 * <li>The {@link Writer writer} that the action will use can be replaced;
 * <li>The action can be {@link ActionContributionOptions#skipAction() skipped} altogether;
 * <li>An {@link ActionInterceptor interceptor} can be {@link
 *     ActionContributionOptions#addInterceptor(ActionInterceptor) added}.
 * </ul>
 * An action contribution is being created with a {@link ActionParameter parameter}. This parameter can be passed to the
 * action, but it can also be used to base logic on (e.g. whether or not the action should be executed).
