/**
 * A context that is used throughout the processing of one template.
 * <p>
 * A context can contain variables. Each variable is stored in a certain scope. At the very minimum, implementations are
 * required to support the <i>template</i> scope, though it's possible to add scopes. Scopes that are added can be
 * removed as well.
 * <p>
 * A context can have a number of implicit objects, which are not scoped. Implicit objects can be {@link
 * #addImplicitObject(String, Object) added} and {@link #removeImplicitObject(String) removed} freely, although their
 * names should not start with {@value #RESERVED_IMPLICIT_OBJECT_NAME_PREFIX}. Subclasses can further restrict the names
 * that may be used for implicit names. All contexts should have an implicit object named {@value
 * #ALUMINUM_IMPLICIT_OBJECT} that is a {@link Map Map&lt;String, Object&gt;}. This implicit object shouldn't be used
 * directly, but is meant for internal use only.
 * <p>
 * When a context supports it, it's possible to create one or more child contexts. The parent of such a child context
 * can be {@link #getParent() obtained} and will be used when {@link #findVariable(String) finding variables}.
